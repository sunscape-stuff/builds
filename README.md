### Release types
- Old: These builds are old and are no longer receiving support, if you're on an old build and are having issues, it's very likely that your issue was fixed in the next build.
- Developer Test Build (DTB): These builds may be **very** unstable and are not recommended for daily use, although they may be bumped up to "PTB" or "Stable" if they're found to be usable.
- Public Test Build (PTB): These builds are for testing and may have *some* issues, they may be bumped to "Stable" if there are no issues found in them.
- Stable: These builds are known to be stable and should have no issues.

Builds are bumped up and down depending on their state, whether they are stable, whether they're out of date/old/deprecated, etc.

## Disclaimer
Sunscape is a community project, therefore **you** (the user) are responsible for whatever you end up doing with your device, we can't be held responsible for any of your mishaps and/or damages, as we only provide a kernel and ROM, both of which are used personally by me (@David112x) and there's internal testing done with each ROM build prior to their release, however this testing is not enough to determine whether the build can be labelled as stable before it's release.

As for kernel builds, we already know that they're all released in it's respective channel and we let you know if one of those builds doesn't work and maybe the reason as to why a build in particular may not work.

If you're using any mods that may affect the stability of a ROM in a specific area, you will not receive support for that area or any other areas affected by the modification.
